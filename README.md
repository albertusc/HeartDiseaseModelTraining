This Python script conducts an in-depth analysis of heart disease prediction using machine learning techniques. It begins by preparing the dataset, handling categorical variables, and addressing missing values. The script explores the data through visualizations, depicting the distribution of heart disease cases and age groups. Following data exploration, it preprocesses the data further, splitting it into features and target variables, encoding categorical features, and partitioning the dataset into training and testing sets.

The core of the analysis lies in model evaluation, where three different algorithms are employed: Logistic Regression, Lasso Regression, and Ridge Regression. These models are evaluated based on various metrics such as accuracy, classification reports, confusion matrices, mean squared error (MSE), R-squared, mean absolute error (MAE), and area under the curve (AUC). Each model's performance is assessed rigorously to understand its predictive capabilities.

Finally, the script compares the models' performance using ROC AUC scores and learning curves. This comparison helps in identifying the most effective model for heart disease prediction. Overall, the script serves as a comprehensive guide to analyzing heart disease prediction using machine learning, offering insights into model performance and aiding in decision-making regarding model selection for real-world applications.
